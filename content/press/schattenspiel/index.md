## About

My name is Tobias and I'm a 19 year old indie game developer. I started programming in 2013 and released my first game in 2015.

The idea for the Schattenspiel came with the repair of a broken lamp. Without the lampshade, the lamp casted a shadow pattern against the wall. This inspired me to create this minimalistic puzzle game about shadows
