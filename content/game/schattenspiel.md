# A Game of Puzzles and Shadows
Lamps emit light, while blocks create shadows. It's a simple concept, but with endless possibilities. Manipulate the shadows by dragging and dropping lamps and blocks to create unique patterns and designs. Tap on a lamp to turn it on or off, and connect two lamps to create a larger light source. 

With over 140 levels to explore, you can challenge yourself to solve each perfectly with a given amount of moves. Each level is a masterpiece on its own, showcasing the creative potential of light and shadow. Whether you're a casual player or a seasoned puzzle-solver, this game offers a fun and engaging way to explore the art of manipulating light and shadow.
